# Curbing the Ramifications of Authorship Abuse in Science

This repository contains the code used to analyze bibliometric data, generate publication‐quality figures (e.g., heatmaps, distribution plots), and evaluate our Fibonacci-adjusted metrics that address authorship abuse in scientific publications. The associated dataset is hosted in a separate repository.

## Introduction

In this project, we present a comprehensive analysis of bibliometric data spanning 34 years and approximately 5000 author profiles across multiple scientific disciplines. The code in this repository includes dataset creation codes and data analysis codes alanlyzing the rising number of author trend and comparision for Fibonacci adjusted metrics with their traditional counter metrics.

## Features

- **Novel Metrics:**  
  Derivation, evaluation, and benchmarking of new bibliometric indicators.
- **Visualization:**  
  Generation of various figures including heatmaps, statistical distributions, and trend analyses.
- **Reproducibility:**  
  Scripts and documentation are provided to enable full reproduction of our analyses and figures.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`
